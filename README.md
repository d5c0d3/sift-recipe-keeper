## Features

- **Free & Open Source** — No ads, no subscriptions, no hidden costs.
- **Unlimited Recipes** — Everything stored locally on your device.
- **Import from Any Website** — Save recipes with a single tap.
- **Bring Your Own Model** — Connect to any OpenAI-compatible API for full control over your data and costs.


## How It Works

Sift fetches a webpage and uses AI to extract just the recipe, leaving behind ads, stories, and other clutter. You get a clean, easy-to-follow recipe card.

To get started, go to `Settings > AI Setup` and enter your provider's API Endpoint, Model Name, and API Key.
